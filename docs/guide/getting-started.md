# Getting started

Scaffold a Defold project with TypeScript sources, write a script, and build to Lua. The whole loop runs on Bun — no `npm` or `node`.

## Install Bun

Follow the official instructions at [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/). Verify:

```sh
bun --version
```

You need Bun `>= 1.3`.

## Install the CLI

```sh
bun add -d @defold-typescript/cli
```

The package exposes a single binary, `defold-typescript`.

## Scaffold a project

```sh
mkdir my-game && cd my-game
bunx defold-typescript init
```

`init` writes a minimal Defold project (`game.project`, `main/main.collection`, `main/main.script`) alongside a TypeScript surface (`src/main.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`). The Defold files are real engine inputs; the TypeScript files are what you edit.

The scaffold also ships an opinionated `biome.json` and adds `@biomejs/biome` to your `devDependencies`, so the project lints and formats cleanly out of the box. An existing `biome.json` is left untouched.

## Write a script

Open `src/main.ts` and replace its body with:

```ts
function init(this: unknown): void {
  const start = vmath.vector3(0, 0, 0);
  const offset = vmath.vector3(1, 1, 0);
  const target = start.add(offset);
  print(`target: ${target.x}, ${target.y}, ${target.z}`);
}
```

`vmath`, `print`, and the `Vector3` shape are available as ambient globals — no imports needed.

## Build to Lua

```sh
bunx defold-typescript build
```

The build command transpiles every TypeScript file under `src/` to Lua and writes the output into the Defold project tree. Open the project in the [Defold editor](./defold-editor.md) (or run it from the command line) to play it.

## Iterate

```sh
bunx defold-typescript watch
```

`watch` rebuilds incrementally on every TypeScript source change: it holds one long-lived transpile session and re-reads and rewrites only the files you actually edited, skipping the re-glob and re-read of unchanged sources. Use it while the Defold editor is open in the same project directory. See [code editor setup](./editor-setup.md) for the VSCode and integrated-terminal loop.

## Release smoke (maintainers)

Before publishing, run the packed-artifact smoke check from the repo root:

```sh
bun run smoke
```

It packs all three `@defold-typescript/*` tarballs, installs them into a throwaway
project outside the monorepo, and drives the installed `defold-typescript` bin
under both `node` and `bun` through `init` → `build` → `tsc --noEmit` → a bounded
`watch`. This proves a real consumer flow that the in-workspace tests cannot — the
published packages resolve and run on a clean machine. It touches the network and
the filesystem outside the repo, so it is a manual check, not a CI gate.

## Next

- Read [vector math](./vector-math.md) for the arithmetic methods on `Vector3`, `Vector4`, `Quaternion`, and `Matrix4`.
- Read [TypeScript gotchas](./typescript-gotchas.md) for the sharp edges the type system cannot catch on its own — starting with the unary-minus quirk on `Vector3`.
