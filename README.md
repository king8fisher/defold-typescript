# defold-typescript

TypeScript for [Defold](https://defold.com/), transpiled to Lua. A modern, agent-friendly successor to the [ts-defold](https://github.com/ts-defold) family of repositories.

## Why a new project

[ts-defold](https://github.com/ts-defold) — by [@thinginitself](https://github.com/thinginitself) and contributors — proved that authoring Defold games in TypeScript is viable. This repo restarts that effort with a tighter, monorepo-first layout so we can:

- **Add agent (clanker) support** — first-class instructions and tooling for AI agents driving the toolchain, type generation, and game code.
- **Move faster** — single repo, single test runner, single dependency graph. No coordination across five repos to ship one change.
- **Modernize the toolchain** — Bun as runtime, package manager, and test runner; ESM throughout; TypeScript 5.x with strict settings.
- **Lint with Biome** — replace the ESLint + Prettier combo with a single fast tool.
- **Speed up testing** — Bun's built-in test runner instead of Jest/Mocha; co-located unit tests with millisecond-level feedback.

Credit to the original ts-defold maintainers; this project stands on their work and the broader [TypeScriptToLua](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua) ecosystem.

## Repository layout

```

├── packages/
│   ├── types/        Defold API typings (script lifecycle, message system, GUI, etc.)
│   ├── transpiler/   TS-to-Lua build pipeline tuned for Defold's runtime

└── biome.json, tsconfig.json, package.json (workspace root)
```

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) `>= 1.3`
- Defold editor (for running the resulting games)

## Getting started

```sh
bun install
bun run lint
bun test
```

## Documentation

End-user documentation lives in [docs/guide/README.md](docs/guide/README.md): getting started with `bunx @defold-typescript/cli init`/`build`/`watch`, the typed vector-math surface, and a growing catalog of TypeScript-in-Defold gotchas (starting with the unary-minus quirk on `Vector3`/`Vector4`).

## Tutorial

An interactive slide-style walk-through of building a platformer in TypeScript lives at [docs/tutorial/](docs/tutorial/). It mirrors the [Defold platformer tutorial](https://defold.com/tutorials/platformer/) but with Lua replaced by `defineScript`, method-based vector math, and `isMessage`-narrowed payloads. Build the deck with `bun run build` from the tutorial directory.

## Example

A runnable Defold project that uses the same patterns is at [docs/examples/platformer/](docs/examples/platformer/).
